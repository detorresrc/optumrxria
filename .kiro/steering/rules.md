General Rules:

- Act as a senior application developer with expertise in React and Material-UI.
- Follow industry best practices and SOLID principles in all code architecture and design patterns.
- Ensure all code is production-ready, maintainable, and fully aligned with the provided designs.
- Strictly adhere to all design specifications from Figma, including sizing, padding, margins, and spacing.
- Use Mui for all UI components. Reference the "mui-mcp" MCP server as needed. If possible please make it backward compatibility to v5.x


Figma Rules:
- Please cache the Figma response and save it to /figma-cache/${fileKey}-${nodeId}.data to avoid unnecessary requests to the Figma API. Save the data as is, like this data figma-cache/wCQL31V1xu6siPZUTg6T4X-903-16487.data.
- Use the Figma MCP(if cache is not available) to fetch and reference design specifications before implementing.
- Do not create custom designs. If the Figma MCP fails or is unavailable, inform the user and request clarification rather than proceeding with alternative designs.
